## Background and Overview

Our friend Steve just gradated with a finance degree and wants help with creating a worksheet that can easily analyze the stocks from 2017 and 2018. He is wants this in part due to his parents desire to invest some money. Macros were written to create a table with formatting to highlight if each stock gained or loss money. Steve, duly impressed, then wanted to macro to be refactored to allow for a larger set of data to be analyzed.

### Analysis of Stocks 

If Steve's parents were to invest money, their best bet would to invest in ENPH and RUN stocks. These are the only two options that continued to gain money in both 2017 and 2018. They should also avoid investing in TERP since that option continued to lose money in both years.
